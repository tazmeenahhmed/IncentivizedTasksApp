                Incentived Habits is built for people bad at keeping routine habits. Keep track of your habits here, with a little reward money as incentive
                to complete them!

                <h2>1. Add a Habit</h2>
                <p>
                    Add a habit by clicking "Add a New Habit" at the bottom of the page. Fill out the ensuing popup form, and a new habit card will appear on the home
                    page with all the relevant information. When completing a habit, click on the top right circle on the habit card to mark it off. Habits refresh daily,
                    weekly, or monthly depending on the frequency you've chosen on the form.

                <p>
                    The monetary value of a habit is decided by you upon making a new habit card. Each time a habit is checked off, that value amount is added to the grand
                    total as displayed on the top of the page. Unchecking a habit will detract that amount from the grand total as well. You can also detract an amount from 
                    the grand total manually if you decide to cash out from that spending money. Keep consistent on your habits to save up for something on your wishlist!

                <p>
                    A habit can be deleted by clicking the "x" at the top right corner of a habit card. Deleting a habit will not delete any previously money earned in
                    the grand total. Once a habit is deleted, it is gone forever and cannot be brought back.

                <p>
                    The wishlist is a place where you can organize items that you would like to spend the grand total savings money on. Add a new item to the wishlist by
                    clicking "Add a new item to the wishlist" towards the top right corner of the wishlist page. A wishlist item will display the item, a description,
                    an image, it's price, and how much money there is left to save towards getting it from the grand total or if you've saved enough to buy the item. 
                    Remove a wishlist item by clicking the "x" on the right of the item description.
